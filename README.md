This reposity serves as a wrapper for an academic digital library of PDFs. It uses a simple d3 + flask app to visualize and explore the library.

Simply put the hierarchical file structure for your library in the main folder (i.e next to the `papers-we-love folder`). Then, when you want to explore
your files, simply run the below code. 

```
cd app
python app.py
```
